"""Walk through unserialised Python dict/list objects and inject
badness at each key/value. Badness is provided in a dict that has one
or more keys, and each key has a list of bad values that are to be
injected into that key.

E.g.:
key1 -> list of bad things to be injected for key1
key2 -> list of bad things to be injected for key1
None -> list of bad things to be injected generally

The key "None" is used for general in injection.

This is done because this allows us to fuzz the values for keys with specific
valid samples for each key separately.
